# 39K-In-the-Zone-2018-2019
This is 39K System Overload's repository for all of our code and programming for the game IN THE ZONE for the 2018-2019 season.
This platform allows us to track our revision history for our team in a more organized, efficient manner
Version control is very important for VEX, because of the innumerous program changes that are inevitable when working with an evolving robot.
We write our code in ROBOTC first, edit it in ATOM and then store it here on GITHUB.
